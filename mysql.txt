Run a command like below to give access from specific IP.

Three changes were made to get it working. Please see attached.




1. Firewall IPtables changes to open 3306




2. change MySQL config to bind to IP, 

my.cnf# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.


comment this line: bind-address = 127.0.0.1

#bind-address    = 192.168.1.151
#skip-networking


3. Grant access to remote users
